# State of Ohio Crime Analysis 2020 - 2022

## Context

Often times people move because of a work requirement, hopes of a different cost of living situation, and/or they enjoy 
what a particular city/state entertainment scene. However, I know in my case I never truly understood 
how safe/unsafe an area has been when deciding to move to a desired city/state.

## Purpose

My intent with this project is to conduct an analysis on the types of crime that has occurred for an entire state. This project can 
be beneficial to anyone who would like to understand crimes in Ohio - current/future Ohio residents and/or government officials 
who want to understand how crime has trended from 2020-2022 in Ohio. The latter audience can also use this information to understand 
what types of laws, resources, and/or police training/staffing may be needed to deter/reduce the types of crimes that have occurred
in different parts of the state.

  - Questions I would like to answer with my analysis:

      1. What are the major types of crime that occurs in Ohio state by City/County?
      2. Are there certain types of crimes that are more common in small, medium, and large cities?
      3. What is the year-over-year trend of crime throughout the buckeye state?
      4. Are there any surprises from the crime datasets?
